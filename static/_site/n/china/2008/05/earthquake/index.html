  <h2>The Earthquake</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>As you've probably heard by now, there was a massive earthquake in China yesterday.  The reports are that it was a 7.9 on the Richter scale.  The latest numbers I've heard are that more than 10,000 are dead, and that number is likely to increase.  You can definitely keep China and the rescue effort in your prayers this week.</p> <p>Some people have asked if anything happened here.  The epicenter was in Sichuan province near Chengdu, about a thousand miles from here.  So no, we didn't feel anything, although I heard that the quake was felt as far away as Beijing, Shanghai and Vietnam.</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6401909844167822225-750354321677083953?l=myronmarston.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Well, I'm back in Qinhuangdao from Hong Kong and Taiwan. My time in Hong Kong and Taiwan was enjoyable, but not very eventful. I've got more about my time in China that I plan to blog about, but recently I've focused all my computer time on finishing a project that I'll be putting on my resume for when I apply for jobs. So blogging just isn't a priority right now.</p>
    <p>The Olympics don't officially start until tomorrow night, but some of the events have already began. I went to the USA vs. Norway women's soccer game last night. Unfortunately, we lost 2-0, but it was fun to go. I'll be going to 3 different events in Beijing before flying home in 6 days!</p>
