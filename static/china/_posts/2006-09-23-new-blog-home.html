Several websites mentioned that blogger is blocked in China but Xanga is not.  So I started a <a href="http://www.xanga.com/myronmarston">xanga blog</a>.<br><br>It turns out that they're wrong.   Blogger is not blocked in China.  I much prefer Blogger to Xanga, and since Blogger isn't blocked in China and my blogging is just getting started...I've decided to switch.  So this is my new blog home :).  Blogger's got some nice features--for example, you know longer have to register to leave a comment!--so I thought it worth the switch.<br><br>I also got the internet installed at my apartment today, so now it'll be much easier to post stuff. There's a bunch of stuff I've wanted to blog about but haven't been able to since I didn't have an internet connection.  So there should be several posts in the next several days.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6401909844167822225-8127283939068019645?l=myronmarston.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
