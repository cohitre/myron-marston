A lot of times we watch a movie or play a game, but we recently found a bowling alley downtown that has a "happy hour" between 5 and 7:30 pm (only 5 <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">RMB</span> for the shoes, and 3 <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">RMB</span> per game per person), so Josh (another <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">ELT</span> Edge teacher teaching here at <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">QFPLC</span>) and I took some students bowling on Friday.  It was the first time any of them bowled, so needless to say, none of them did terribly well, although a couple of them got a strike, which is more than can be said for me.  I bowled worse than I have in years.<br><br>In case you're wondering what a Chinese bowling alley is like, it's almost exactly like a bowling alley in the states.  They seem to have the same software for the score-keeping computers.  However, the machines that clear away the pins and set up pins for the next frame don't work as well as ours do in the states...several times it would set the pins down and one would immediately fall over. <br><br>All in all, it was a fun way to spend a night.   I'll probably be taking students bowling again.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6401909844167822225-993938090429138232?l=myronmarston.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
