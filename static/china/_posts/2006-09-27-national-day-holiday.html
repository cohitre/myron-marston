October 1st is China's National Holiday, celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1st, 1949.  It seems to be a bigger deal then the 4th of July is in the US.  In the US, we don't usually get the day off work, but here in China, we get the entire week off. I'm going to use my week off to do some travelling. <br><br>I'm travelling with a group of other foreign teachers--about 10 of us total, I believe.  We're going to Changbai Shan (which you can read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changbai_Mountains">here</a>, <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/TR-e/12712.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://www2.unesco.org/mab/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=CPR+01">here</a>), a mountain range that seperates China from North Korea.  We're also planning to visit the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalian">Dalian</a>.<br><br>We leave Saturday morning.  This'll probably be my last blog post for a while since I'll be travelling.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6401909844167822225-5169908448694538572?l=myronmarston.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
