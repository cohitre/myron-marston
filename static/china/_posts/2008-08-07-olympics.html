Well, I'm back in Qinhuangdao from Hong Kong and Taiwan.  My time in Hong Kong and Taiwan was enjoyable, but not very eventful.  I've got more about my time in China that I plan to blog about, but recently I've focused all my computer time on finishing a project that I'll be putting on my resume for when I apply for jobs.  So blogging just isn't a priority right now.<br><br>The Olympics don't officially start until tomorrow night, but some of the events have already began.  I went to the USA vs. Norway women's soccer game last night.  Unfortunately, we lost 2-0, but it was fun to go.  I'll be going to 3 different events in Beijing before flying home in 6 days!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6401909844167822225-2300520823382743596?l=myronmarston.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
