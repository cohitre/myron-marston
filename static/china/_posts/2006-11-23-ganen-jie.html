Happy Thanksgiving!  Today is Ganen Jie (that is, Thanksgiving Day in Chinese).  I'll be celebrating Thanksgiving with the other <a href="http://www.eltedge.org/">ELT Edge</a> teachers on Saturday.  Tonight we had a thanksgiving dinner with the foreign teachers here at QFPLC (which included 4 of the ELT Edge teachers plus a bunch of other foreigners).  It was a Chinese meal, so it wasn't much like a real thanksgiving dinner, but it was good, nonetheless.<br><br>Anyhow, this week I got inspired to compose for the first time in a long time--definitely the first time since I've come to China (I think the last thing I composed was a piece for my cousin's wedding back in March).  I'm extremely happy with this piece--I think it's the best piece I've ever composed.  The form is similar to some of my other pieces--in this case it's ABACABA--but there are a lot of creative things I managed to do with it.  I purposely tried to force myself to do some unusual things like make some parts 5 bars or 9 bars instead of the usual 4 or 8.  And man, the MIDI sounds coming out of <a href="http://www.finalemusic.com/finale/">Finale</a> have never sounded so good--particularly the oboe.  If I close my eyes, I feel like I'm hearing a real oboe, especially with the really nice vibrato finale gives it.  Anyhow, I finished the piece today, so it seemed appropriate to call it "Ganen Jie".  Give it a listen.  And I always welcome feedback :).<br><br><a href="http://www.archive.org/download/MyronMarston_GanenJie/Ganen_Jie.mp3"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ganen Jie</span></a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6401909844167822225-4560888127693891326?l=myronmarston.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
