I received two Christmas packages today!  One came from my family and one came from <a href="http://www.graceseattle.org/">my church</a> in Seattle.   The packages contained lots of goodies:<br><ul>
<li>Butterfingers &amp; Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (two of my favorite candies...I love peanut butter!)</li>
<li>Beef Jerky</li>
<li>My sister-in-law's amazing pistachio bread (Thanks Leah!!  You know how much I love your pistachio bread!)</li>
<li>Hot Chocolate packs</li>
<li>A box of cereal</li>
<li>Crackers and Cheese</li>
<li>Some peanut butter wafer cookies</li>
<li>Time "The Year in Review" magazine</li>
<li>A couple of movies</li>
</ul>Thanks for those who sent packages.  Anyone else who wants to send me a package is welcome to :).<br><br>Anyhow, we're having a Christmas party here in about 30 minutes with the other ELT Edge teachers.  Should be a good time.  We're having another one on Christmas day with the other foreign teachers here at QFPLC. <br><br>Merry Christmas!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6401909844167822225-6583024243281182815?l=myronmarston.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
