I haven't been very good about posting this semester.  I apologize for that.  One reason is because I have been very busy, specifically with creating <a href="http://www.ghostsandspirits.net/">www.ghostsandspirits.net</a>.  It's not quite complete (I'm still waiting for Phil to update several of the pages), but I'm happy with what we have so far.  Check out the album, listen to the songs and leave comments if you like.<br><br>I'm leaving in two hours for about a month.  This time the plan is to go to Shenzhen and Hong Kong, then fly to Thailand for a week, then fly back to China and go to Yunnan, Tibet and Xinjiang.  I'll be traveling with Drew Langlie, <a href="/china/2007/04/24/winter-travels-recap">who I traveled with last winter</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6401909844167822225-305426904844932944?l=myronmarston.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
