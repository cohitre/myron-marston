<p>As you've probably heard by now, there was a massive earthquake in China yesterday.  The reports are that it was a 7.9 on the Richter scale.  The latest numbers I've heard are that more than 10,000 are dead, and that number is likely to increase.  You can definitely keep China and the rescue effort in your prayers this week.</p> <p>Some people have asked if anything happened here.  The epicenter was in Sichuan province near Chengdu, about a thousand miles from here.  So no, we didn't feel anything, although I heard that the quake was felt as far away as Beijing, Shanghai and Vietnam.</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6401909844167822225-750354321677083953?l=myronmarston.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
