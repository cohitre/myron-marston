Sorry that I haven't posted recently.  I'm back in China, but blogspot is still blocked by the great firewall of China, and I haven't got around to installing Tor on my new laptop yet.  At the moment, I can post on here because I'm travelling and I'm staying at a hostel that has tor installed on its computers. <br><br>This week is national day holiday week, a full week off of school.  I'm travelling with my buddy Liu Kai (<a href="/n/china/2007/02/trip-summary">who I travelled with last winter</a>).  We're currently at a hostel in the ancient walled city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingyao">Pingyao</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanxi">Shanxi</a> province.  Later this week we'll be going to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yungang_Grottoes">Yungang Caves</a>, which features a ton of buddhist sculptures and various other works of art.  (Check out <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=Yungang+Caves&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi">the results of Google Image search</a>!).<br><br>I'll be sure to post pictures later.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6401909844167822225-7154126269245083231?l=myronmarston.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
