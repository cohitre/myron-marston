Finals just finished last week, and many people are asking me, "what's next?"  I'm not totally sure, but I do know some of what I'll be doing in the near future...<br><ul>
<li>On July 5th, I head to Hong Kong.  I'll be there about a week.  The main reason I'm going is to get a tourist visa so I can come back to China in August (since my residence permit expires July 15th).</li>
<li>On July 12th, I fly to Taiwan.  I'm going there to help out with an English camp.</li>
<li>I'll return to mainland China on August 3rd, just in time for the start of the Olympics.</li>
<li>I'll be attending several different events during the Olympics: soccer (in Qinhuangdao) and rowing, hockey and handball (in Beijing).</li>
<li>On August 13th, I fly back to Seattle.</li>
</ul>After that, I really have no idea...<br><br>One cool bit of news I found out today: the tickets I have for the August 6th soccer game is USA vs. Norway.  I bought the tickets several months ago, so I'm lucky I get to see the USA in the one soccer game I'm going to :).<br><br>Also, there are a few other trips I took the last two years that I haven't had time to blog about yet, but I still intend to, just for the sake of completeness and so that I don't forget.  So check back here in the future for those updates.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6401909844167822225-5562716077142620979?l=myronmarston.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
