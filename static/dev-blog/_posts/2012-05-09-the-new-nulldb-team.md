A few weeks ago, I
[announced](/n/dev-blog/2012/04/new-nulldb-maintainer-needed)
that I was looking for a new NullDB maintainer.  Since then,
multiple people have stepped forward and I'm happy to announce
the formation of a [NullDB core team](https://github.com/nulldb):

* Arvind Laxminarayan ([github](https://github.com/ardsrk) | [twitter](https://twitter.com/ardsrk))
* Isaac Sanders ([github](https://github.com/isaacsanders) | [twitter](https://twitter.com/isaacsanders))
* Matt Van Horn ([github](https://github.com/mattvanhorn) | [twitter](https://twitter.com/nycplayer))
* Woody Peterson ([github](https://github.com/woahdae))

Please join me in thanking Arvind, Isaac, Matt and Woody for stepping
forward and taking over maintainance on this project. I'm confident the
project can move forward with a much better direction now that I won't
be the bottleneck anymore!
