I've just released VCR 2.0.0 final. This marks the culmination of 6
months of work, and involved re-writing large portions of VCR.

VCR 2 is far more flexible than VCR 1.x ever was. The
[Upgrade](https://github.com/myronmarston/vcr/blob/v2.0.0/Upgrade.md)
doc has a high-level listing of most of the new features. I've also
blogged about the new stuff:

* [Custom Request Matchers in VCR 2.0](/n/dev-blog/2011/10/custom-request-matchers-in-vcr-2-0)
* [Cassettes in VCR 2.0](/n/dev-blog/2011/11/cassettes-in-vcr-2-0)
* [VCR 2.0.0 RC Released!](/n/dev-blog/2011/12/vcr-2-0-0-rc-released)
* [VCR 2.0.0 RC2 Released!](/n/dev-blog/2012/02/vcr-2-0-0-rc2-released)
