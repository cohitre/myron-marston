There's been an [on-going](http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/06/23/how-ruby-helps-you-fix-your-broken-code/)
[discussion](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2011/06/ruby-verbose-mode/) in the ruby community recently about
warnings. I've never used ruby's `-w` much, but I'm always in favor of
more automated tools that can help improve our code.
