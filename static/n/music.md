# Music

I have a BA in Music from [Seattle Pacific University](http://spu.edu/),
and used to do a fair bit of recording and composition.

Unfortunately, I rarely have the time (or energy) for music these days,
but I've collected a few of my recordings and compositions here.

## Recordings

I played lead guitar on all of these.
