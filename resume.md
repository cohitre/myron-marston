## Examples of My Work

I've written and maintain several gems:

* [VCR](http://github.com/myronmarston/vcr): Record your test suite's HTTP interactions
  and replay them during future test runs for fast, deterministic, accurate tests.  Featured on the
  [ruby 5 podcast](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/episodes/83-episode-81-june-1-2010/stories/699-vcr-record-rewind-and-playback-web-services).
* [Mail Safe](http://github.com/myronmarston/mail_safe): Keep your actionmailer emails from escaping into
  the wild during development.  Featured on the
  [ruby 5 podcast](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/episodes/27-episode-26-november-10-2009/stories/210-send-mail-safely-with-mail_safe).
* [Null DB](http://github.com/nulldb/nulldb): An ActiveRecord null database adapter
  for greater speed and isolation in unit tests.  ([Avdi Grimm](http://avdi.org) originally wrote it;
  I'm the current maintainer).
* A few smaller projects, including [Column Timestamps](http://github.com/myronmarston/column_timestamps),
  [Email Blacklist](http://github.com/myronmarston/email_blacklist) and
  [Test Benchmarker](http://github.com/myronmarston/test_benchmarker).

I've also contributed to numerous projects, including:

* RSpec [core](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/commits/master?author=myronmarston),
  [expectations](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/commits/master?author=myronmarston),
  [mocks](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/commits/master?author=myronmarston) and
  [rails](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/commits/master?author=myronmarston)
